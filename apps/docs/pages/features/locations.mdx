# Locations

Locations are paths to a directory or volume on a [Client]() to be indexed and stored within a [Library]().

The user should be promted to add at least one location during onboarding.

Locations are immediately indexed in their entirety.

```rust
 struct Location {
    id: u32,
    name: String,
    total_capacity: u32,
    available_capacity: u32,
    is_removable: bool,
    is_ejectable: bool,
    is_root_filesystem: bool,
    is_online: bool,
    library_id: u32,
    client_id: u32,
    date_created: Option<NaiveDateTime>,
    last_indexed: Option<NaiveDateTime>,
}
```
