### What is it?

Spacedrive is an open source virtual filesystem, a personal cloud powered by your everyday devices. Feature-rich benefits of the cloud, only its owned and hosted by you—with security, privacy and ownership as a foundation. Spacedrive makes it possible to create a **limitless directory** of your digital life that will stand the test of time.

#### A single source of truth, for every file you own.

For each client you install, you'll have another node in your personal network. They all share a single encrypted database and work as a team to perform tasks. Prioritizing peer-to-peer LAN connections but always using end-to-end encryption to synchronize in realtime.

As for UI, it has everything you'd expect from a file explorer and more; a native photo viewer, video and audio player. But also _specific_ support for VODs, git repositories, social media backups, NFTs, screenshots, webpage snapshots, links, notes and more. Community extensions can add support for different filetypes and tailored file viewers.
