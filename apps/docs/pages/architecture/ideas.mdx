### Architecture

```javascript
import '../styles/fonts.css';
import '../styles/globals.css';
```

```rust
pub enum Action {
  SCAN_DIR,
  ENCRYPT_FILE,
  UPLOAD_FILE,
}
```

- **meta_integrity_hash**<br />
  `location + path`<br />
  This allows us to quickly assume a file we have already scanned still exists at that location.<br />
  _Note: Could potentiallty be replaced by a unique constraint on location+path_
- **sample_byte_integrity_hash**<br />
  `100 * 100 byte samples at equal points throughout file`<br />
  this is used to find duplicates quickly
- **byte_integrity_hash**<br />
  `full byte-to-byte checksum on file contents`<br />
  this is used to confirm duplicates

path must be stored so we can handle system delete events and update database accordingly
^ of course but that‚Äôs a simple query on destructured volume/location/path

duplicate files should have a new File created but it receives no metadata, the parent File, aka the first instance discovered, consumes all metadata and master_file_id determines this link

add deleted_at to File

.spacedrive file can exist in a directory to identify it as something other than a directory, such as a single file with a custom UI

we can also define hard coded enhancements to the visual display of directories based on context

If a new file has the same sampled_byte_integrity hash on the currently loaded volume we check to see if it still exists at that other location. if so, we assign as a duplicate. if not, we count it as a move and update the original File to the new location.

after every file is updated we run a set of checks, or routines.
or a file being updated puts it into a ‚Äútouched‚Äù state queuing it up for inspection routines

database mutations are processed as commits, through an enum of commit types, we take data and commit it to database

wanted state for missing files

sync server uses redis to queue sync chunks

file types are an enum to allow for extended functionality

```rust
pub enum FileType {
  File,
  RichFile
  Directory,
  Package,
  Alias,
}

pub enum Package {
  WebPage,
  ThumbnailMedia,
  PreviewMedia,
  Custom
}
```

### Promotion

_show a pile of drives_
‚Äúif this is you, you‚Äôll know how much of a pain it is to deal with this much data. We‚Äôre in a world now where independent creatives are the new normal, our data is steadily accumulating but the tooling hasn‚Äôt caught up yet‚Äù

‚ÄúCloud services like Google Photos and iCloud have great features, beautiful UI‚Äîbut you‚Äôre locked in with a very limited capacity. Many people have multiple cloud accounts each with their own restrictions. Drives that aren‚Äôt backed up, collecting dust and at risk of failure.

‚ÄúSpacedrive is a beautiful interface to organize and consume an unlimited amount of data, bringing each and every one of your devices together to form your own cloud. It‚Äôs incredible to see it all come together.

We‚Äôre in a world now where independent creatives are the new normal, our data is steadily accumulating but the tooling hasn‚Äôt caught up yet. Cloud services like Google Photos and iCloud have great features, beautiful UI‚Äîbut you‚Äôre locked in with a very limited capacity. Many people have multiple cloud accounts, drives that aren‚Äôt backed up and collecting dust, data at risk of loss. I wanted a solution that didn‚Äôt tie me to any one provider, a photo album shouldn‚Äôt exist only in my iCloud account, it should be universal and permanent. I believe open source technology is the solution to this, with incredibly an versatile and secure architecture

‚Äúa beautiful, intentionally crafted user interface to effortlessly and continually archive your vast wealth of memories, creations, and data. a digital legacy that is will stand the test of time, and be truly yours.‚Äù

### Storage Device Presets

To improve index quality these presets can be automatically applied to the indexer to avoid paths and handle individual files by a ruleset uniquely

- Macintosh HD
- Windows C:/
- Linux??
