## **Project Proposal: Adaptive AI System with Dynamic Prompt Structuring**

### **Project Overview**

This project aims to develop an adaptive AI system that leverages data structures and human language prompts to program and refine its own behavior. The system will be capable of evaluating its objectives and capabilities in real-time, storing its thoughts, memories, and actions in journals and databases, and dynamically generating its operational structure based on predefined and customizable templates.

### **Key Features**

1. **Agentic Design**:

   - The AI system will be designed with agentic capabilities, allowing it to self-evaluate, refine objectives, and improve its functionality over time.

2. **Memory and Journal System**:

   - The AI will maintain a detailed journal formatted in markdown, enabling it to recall highly summarized memories and information as a guidebook.
   - Memories and thoughts will be stored as `MemoryVector` and `ThoughtProcess` objects, facilitating accurate recall and decision-making.

3. **Dynamic Prompt Structuring**:

   - The system will use the `Prompt` package to attach context and behavior to data structures. This will allow the AI to interpret and act upon the data with minimal hardcoded logic.
   - Prompts will be dynamically structured based on the current objective, using templates that guide how `Prompt` components are arranged and utilized.

4. **Capabilities Module**:

   - A set of core functions (`Capabilities`) will be registered at runtime, allowing the AI to perform actions such as recalling memories, starting thought processes, evaluating itself, and refining objectives.

5. **Stage-Based Action Planning**:

   - Actions will be categorized into stages (e.g., `Plan`, `Execute`, `Reflect`) to guide the AI’s decision-making process at different points in its workflow.

6. **Spacedrive Integration**:
   - The system will navigate Spacedrive’s Virtual Distributed File System (VDFS) and associate context with file and folder structures. This unique method will allow the AI to manage and access relevant data efficiently.

### **Technical Implementation**

- **Prompt-Enabled Structures**:

  - The AI system will use `Prompt` annotations to define and manage the behavior of core data structures like `Objective`, `MemoryVector`, `ThoughtProcess`, and others. This approach enables the AI to operate based on metadata rather than explicit programming logic.

- **Memory Management**:

  - A custom `Memory` trait and macro will be implemented to manage in-memory storage and retrieval of AI-generated data. This will enable the AI to maintain working memory, aiding in dynamic prompt generation and decision-making.

- **Dynamic Template Loading**:

  - Templates will be created and stored to define how prompts should be structured for different objectives. At runtime, the AI will load and apply these templates to generate its operational structure dynamically.

- **Self-Evaluation and Refinement**:
  - The AI will continuously assess its current state and capabilities, using the information to refine its objectives and improve future performance.

### **Expected Outcomes**

- **Adaptability**: The AI system will dynamically adapt to new tasks and environments by recalibrating its operational structure and refining its objectives based on real-time feedback.
- **Scalability**: The modular design will allow for easy expansion of capabilities and integration with additional data sources and systems.
- **Efficiency**: By leveraging Spacedrive’s VDFS and a flexible memory management system, the AI will efficiently store, recall, and act upon relevant data.
- **Innovation**: The project will introduce a novel approach to AI design, emphasizing minimal hardcoding and maximum flexibility through data-driven and prompt-based programming.

### **Timeline**

- **Phase 1**: Design and implement core data structures and memory management.
- **Phase 2**: Develop and integrate the journal and dynamic prompt structuring system.
- **Phase 3**: Implement capabilities and stage-based action planning.
- **Phase 4**: Test and refine the AI system, ensuring it meets adaptability and efficiency goals.
- **Phase 5**: Final integration with Spacedrive VDFS and deployment.

This proposal outlines the project’s objectives, features, and technical approach, providing a clear path forward for developing an advanced and adaptive AI system.

// Notes:
// - The model will be the basis of its own programming. It will write to journals, databases, and other data sources to store its thoughts and memories and methods for interacting with the user.
// - Capabilities, which are functions that take in data and return data, are registered at runtime.
// - Agentic design: the model will be able to evaluate itself and refine its objectives and capabilities.
// - Least programming possible: using the Prompt package we can attach context to our data structures, and default CRUD operations for the AI to use. We can effectively design a complex system with just data declarations and human language prompts.
// - Utilize virtual sidecar files to store generated data for files via Spacedrive
// - This system will have a unique way of navigating Spacedrive's VDFS and associating context to file and folder structures at any depth.
// Once a Prompt enabled struct is registered with the runtime, the AI can interpret how to use it base on the metadata. We will need to design some more configuration options for the Prompt derive macro to allow for more complex behavior.
// - Prompt templates allow for different styles of prompt formation, otherwise the default is hardcoded via the Prompt derive macro.

## Syntax

```rust
#[derive(Clone, Debug, Expressible)]
#[express(description = "Describe a person", category = "entity", cardinality = "multiple")]
struct Person {
    #[express(weight = 2, meaning = "The person's full name")]
    name: String,
    #[express(weight = 1, meaning = "The person's age in years")]
    age: u32,
}

define_concept!(Person);

#[capability(
    name = "Remember",
    description = "Stores a memory into the system."
)]
fn remember(thought: Thought) -> Result<(), CapabilityError> {
    // Implementation logic to store the memory vector
    Ok(())
}

fn main() {
    // Define the concept
    register_concept::<Person>();

    // Create and store an instance
    let person = Person {
        name: "John Doe".to_string(),
        age: 30,
    };
    person.store();

    // List all defined concepts with their expressions
    println!("Defined Concepts:\n{}", list_defined_concepts());

    // List all capabilities
    println!("Capabilities:\n{}", list_capabilities());
}
```
