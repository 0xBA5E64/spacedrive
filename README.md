# Spacedrive
The worlds first private virtual filesystem.


## Apps
- `desktop`: a [Tauri](https://nextjs.org) app
- `mobile`: a [React Native](https://nextjs.org) app
- `web`: another [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) app
- `docs`: a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) app
  
## Packages
All TypeScript packages are compiled automatically, other native binaries including Rust packages must be compiled by a host app at build time.
- `core`: the [Rust]() core logic library, referred to internally as `sdcorelib`
- `state`: the [TypeScript]() core logic library
- `ui`: a [React Native]() / [RNW]() component library
- `config`: `eslint` configurations (includes `eslint-config-next`, `eslint-config-prettier` and all `tsconfig.json` configs used throughout the monorepo



## Utilities
This turborepo has some additional tools already setup for you:

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for static type checking
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for code linting
- [Jest](https://jestjs.io) test runner for all things JavaScript
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io) for code formatting

## Remote Caching

Turborepo can use a technique known as [Remote Caching (Beta)](https://turborepo.org/docs/features/remote-caching) to share cache artifacts across machines, enabling you to share build caches with your team and CI/CD pipelines.

By default, Turborepo will cache locally. To enable Remote Caching (Beta) you will need an account with Vercel. If you don't have an account you can [create one](https://vercel.com/signup), then enter the following commands:

```
cd my-turborepo
npx turbo login
```

This will authenticate the Turborepo CLI with your [Vercel account](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/personal-accounts/overview).

Next, you can link your Turborepo to your Remote Cache by running the following command from the root of your turborepo:

```
npx turbo link
```
